Implementation

Development Task completed for FrontEnd using React.js, Backend using Node.js and Express, Database Implemenation using MongoDB.

Frontend - React.js

My web application consists of userlogin, signup, confirm password, and a home page. The frontend also consists of a components folder which includes Model.Component file that executes the pop-up messages shown during the user login process. The API consists of authentian for login, register, user, and nodes. It also contains the App.js file that exectes and switches between pages along with the index.js and index.css.

Backend - Node.js and Express

Index.js that constains the routes. The .env file contains 

MONGO_URL= mongodb+srv://mongodb+srv://nishma004:nishma126@cluster0.epnm6va.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PASS_SEC = admin3
PORT = 8000
JWT_SEC = admin3


NODEMAILER_PASSWORD=45540d5f2a1db2
NODEMAILER_EMAIL= cc7d3a7e2e9689
NODEMAILER_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io

To run the frontend application - it's mandatory to run npm install i to install the components. Then, to run the create react app its also require to install "npm install" to load the packages to a specific folder. The same thing happens on the backend for example: npm install. Also, its required to install the modules e.g: node_modules for both the frontend and the backend as mentioned.
